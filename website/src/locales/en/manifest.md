#### Whereas

- Earth is one massive living organism.
- An infinity of life forms coexist interdependently.
- Humanity has a major influence over other terrestrial realms.
- Each human being is a unique and individualized cell of the planet.
- Resilience of an organism is maintained when its cells are fully free to play their roles at the service of the Whole and its parts.

#### I proclaim

- My gratitude towards Life that animates all things.
- My deep respect for all inhabitants of our earthly vessel.
- The primacy of the biological and conscious being that I am, over the legal entity created after my birth.
- The legitimacy of my creative power as long as it excludes any form of theft, deception, moral or physical violence.
- The absolute responsibility for all my thoughts, words and actions of my own free-will.

#### I undertake

- To process my fears so that, with love, I take care of myself and every form of life.
- To seize my power as a living Human Being and use it to serve harmony.
- To resort to joyful and pacific disobedience whenever fundamental rights of Life are in danger.

I acknowledge this pact that links me to myself and the Earth. I connect through my heart with the emancipated Beings of One Nation across all oceans and continents.
