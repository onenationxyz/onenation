## Guidelines

One Nation is Open Source & decentralised.  
This is the original repository (onenation.xyz). It is supposed to remain minimalistic with only the essential: 
- The orignial Manifest (french version)
- The translations of the Manifest in other languages
- The original logo
- The website (multilingual)
- The roadmap

## Contribute

One Nation is headless so you are free to collaborate/append/modifiy/fork anything without asking permission.

As long as your intentions embrace the values of the Manifest, go for it!
