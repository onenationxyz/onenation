        The **Heart** of One Nation
      text1: |
        Governments fail in their mission to take care of Humans and Earth.
        We no longer trust them.
        They have lost our respect. 
      text2: |
        So what can we do?
      text3: |
        Complaints are boring...
        Protests? Too dangerous.
        Elections? Fruitless.
        Fighting? Can't be bothered.

        The **Spirit** of One Nation
      text: |
        One Nation is a **planetary emancipation wave**. In peace, each one regains the power to choose for oneself and refuse interference from non-legitimate authorities.
        
        Where anger and fear give way to **creativity** and **courage**, there is no need for new rulers, nor for new laws and institutions.
        
        The Manifest affirms our **common quest for harmony**.
        This text is the link between all our differences.
        So that mutual trust allows us to **act spontaneously in stigmergy**.

        The **Body** of One Nation
      text: |
        One Nation vibrates in **each one of us** every time a human being signs the Manifest in good faith with its heart and the soul.
        
        Together we form a **decentralised network** of Human Beings and Oases embracing the values of the Manifest
        
        Every oasis, fixed or movable, is free to experiment its own organisation.
        
        One Nation connects **open-source projects** that **build up alternatives to usual instruments of power** such as : identity, money, education, food, medias, ...
