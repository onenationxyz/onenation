## One Nation

Governments fail in their mission to take care of Humans and Earth.  
We no longer trust them.  
They have lost our respect.â€© 

_So what can we do?_

Complaints are boring...  
Protests? Too dangerous.  
Elections? Fruitless.  
Fighting? Can't be bothered.  

**Whaf if we created a nation instead?**

> By **"Nation"** we mean : Vast group of human beings, conscious about their unity and claiming the desire to live together.
