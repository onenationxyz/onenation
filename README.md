## Guidelines

One Nation is Open Source & decentralised.  
This is the original repository (onenation.xyz).  

It is supposed to remain minimalistic with only the essential: 
- The [original Manifest](./manifest/fr_manifeste.md) (french version)
- The [translations of the Manifest](./manifest/) in other languages
- The [original logo](./logo/)
- The [website](https://onenation.xyz) (multilingual)
- The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)

## Contribute

One Nation is headless so you are free to collaborate/append/modifiy/fork anything without asking permission. As long as your intentions embrace the values of the Manifest, go for it!
