![Manifesto One Nation](.github/logo.png)

Governments are failing in their mission.  
They do not care for Human Beings or the Earth.  
We no longer trust them, they have lost our respect.

_But what can we do?_

Complain? Boring...  
Protest? Too dangerous!  
Vote? Fruitless.  
Fight? Can't be bothered!

**What if we would create a nation instead!?**

> **By nation it is meant**: "A rather large group of Human Beings, characterised by an awareness of its unity and by the will to live together".

## Guidelines

One Nation is Open Source & decentralised.  
This is the **first & original repository** (onenation.xyz).  

It is supposed to remain minimalistic with only the essential: 
- The [original Manifesto](./manifest/fr_manifeste.md) (French version)
- The [translations of the Manifesto](./manifest) in other languages
- The [original logo](./logo)
- The [website](https://onenation.xyz) (multilingual)

## Contribute

One Nation is headless, so you are free to collaborate/append/modify/fork anything without asking permission. As long as your intentions embrace the values of the Manifesto, go for it!
