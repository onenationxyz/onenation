## The Manifesto
### #ONENATION

#### Considering that

- Earth is one large living organism.  
- An infinite number of life forms cohabit on it interdependently.  
- Humanity has a major influence over other terrestrial realms.  
- Each human being is a unique and individualized cell of the Earth.  
- The resilience of an organism is maintained when its cells are free to play their roles fully at the service of the Whole and its parts.

#### I proclaim

- My gratitude towards the Life that animates all things.  
- My deep respect for all inhabitants of our earthly vessel.  
- The primacy of the biological and conscious being that I am, over the legal entity created after my birth.  
- The legitimacy of my creative power as long as it excludes any form of theft, deception, moral or physical violence.  
- The absolute responsibility for all my thoughts, words and actions resulting from my free-will.

#### I commit myself to

- Remove fear from my mind so that in love, I can take care of myself and every form of life.  
- Seize my power as a living human being to use it at the service of harmony.  
- Resort to joyful and peaceful disobedience whenever fundamental rights of the living are in danger.

_I, _______________________________________ , acknowledge this pact that binds me to myself and the Earth. On this day of ________________________ , I join  with the heart the emancipated Beings of One Nation across the oceans and continents._
